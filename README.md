# Neural Networks User Behavior Prediction from Event Data

Welcome to the Exania repository, a part of Exohood Labs, ongoing research and development in the field of artificial intelligence. This repository focuses on the development of advanced neural network models for predicting user behavior based on event data. The goal of Exania is to leverage cutting edge machine learning techniques to gain insights into user interactions and behaviors, enabling us to create more personalized and efficient user experiences.

# Introduction

Exania is a research project aimed at tackling the complex problem of user behavior prediction using event data. Event data consists of timestamped interactions between users and a system, such as clicks, purchases, and page views. Predicting user behavior from such data involves modeling intricate patterns and dependencies inherent in human interactions.
Dependencies

# To utilize the Exania project, you will need the following dependencies:

* Python >= 3.6
* TensorFlow >= 2.0
* NumPy >= 1.18
* Pandas >= 1.0
* Scikit-learn >= 0.23

# Data Preprocessing

The event data undergoes a series of preprocessing steps to prepare it for neural network training. This includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and sequence transformation. The transformed data is organized into sequences, capturing temporal patterns of user interactions.

# Neural Network Architecture

Exania employs a sophisticated architecture comprising various components:

* Embedding Layer: Converts categorical features into dense vectors.
* Temporal Encoding Layer: Captures sequential dependencies through recurrent layers (e.g., LSTM).
* Attention Mechanism: Enhances model focus on crucial events.
* Prediction Layer: Generates probability distributions for future user actions.

The mathematical formulations and code implementations of these components can be found in the source code.

# Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using historical event data, where the objective is to minimize the prediction error. Training is performed using backpropagation and optimization algorithms, optimizing model parameters to minimize a suitable loss function. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, among others.

# Results

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Exania in predicting user behavior. The model's accuracy in forecasting user actions has been consistently high, indicating its potential in enhancing user experiences and personalization.

# Usage
